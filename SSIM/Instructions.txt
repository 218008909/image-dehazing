This project made use of the piq libraries to calculate SSIM.
However, a small adjustment was made to enable this functionality.
If you would like to use the version of this project which measures SSIM:
* Rename trainModel_legacy.py and testModel_legacy.py to match
	their counterparts in the main folder, 
	(trainModel.py and testModel.py) and 
	replace the original files with these.
* Comment out line 53 of ssim.py
	This can be found in the following directory
	(PythonLocation)->Lib->site-packages->piq
